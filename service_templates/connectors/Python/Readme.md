# Conventions 

### Tests

* One Class with tests per function
* One test file per Class
* Folders represent files and modules.

### Docker Image

* One docker image as basis for all (at least most) connectors. 
* Debug connection object would be helpful
* A connection is created by ether starting the connection file directly or by starting the container
* All needed to setup a connection should be configuration.
