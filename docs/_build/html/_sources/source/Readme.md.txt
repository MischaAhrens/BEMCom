# BEMCom Documentation

## Before you start

Please note this library relies heavily on Docker and Docker Compose. You may wish to familiarize yourself with these tools before using this library. A good starting point are the getting started pages of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) respectively.

## Overview

This documentation contains of the following parts:

1. [Concepts](./01_concepts.md): Introduces the general high level concepts of BEMCom. This should be read first.
2. [Application Creation](./02_application_creation.md): Provides instructions how HAL applications can be build utilizing the BEMCom framework. This is for for those who wish to use BEMCom.
3. [Message Format](./03_message_format.md): Defines the internal message format that BEMCom services use to communicate within an application. This may become relevant for debugging BEMCom applications but is most relevant for the development of services.
4. [Contributing](./04_contributing.md): Covers additional information relevant while implementing new services or working on existing components. This is for those who wish to extend BEMCom with new components.
