BEMCom Documentation
====================

Welcome to the documentation page of BEMCom, a tool for the rapid implementation of hardware abstraction layers for building energy management.

First Things First
------------------
Please note this library relies heavily on Docker and Docker Compose. You may wish to familiarize yourself with these tools before using this
library. A good starting point are the getting started pages of `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`__ and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/>`__ respectively.

Please note that the first two parts of the documentation (:doc:`01_concepts` and :doc:`02_application_creation`) are important for all those who want to use BEMCom. The remaining parts (:doc:`03_message_format` and :doc:`04_contributing`) are rather relevant for those who want to extend BEMCom with own components.
