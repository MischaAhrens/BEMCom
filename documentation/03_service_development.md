# Development of BEMCom Services

Any BEMCom application can easily extended with new services. If you plan to contribute a service to this repository please ensure you have considered the following points:

* [ ] The code is well documented.The code obeys common conventions and style guides, like e.g. [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python packages.
* [ ] The code contains tests where possible.
* [ ] That you have used one of the [service templates](../service_templates/) if one exists for the service type and programming language.
* [ ] That you have implemented the [message format](./04_message_format.md) correctly and completely.

You may also want to open up an issue to discuss your ideas before starting to work on something to ensure that your work will match into this repo.
