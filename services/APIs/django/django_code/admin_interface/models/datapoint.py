class Datapoint(models.Model):
    """
    Model for a datapoint.

    This model holds the generic information of a datapoint, i.e. the data
    that should be set for every datapoint regardless of which information it
    represents. By default a datapoint can ether hold a numeric information
    (e.g. 2.0912) or a text information (e.g. "OK").

    The use_as attribute of Datapoint defines how the Datapoint should be used.
    It can be ether:
        "not used": The datapoint will not be used, i.e ignored. That means
                    the connector will not publish values for this datapoint
                    over MQTT.
        "numeric":  The datapoint will be used and it represents a numeric
                    information.
        "text":     The datapoint will be used and it represents a string,
                    or at least something that can be stored as a string.

    Depeding on the use case, the datapoint may require (or should be able to
    carry) additional metadata fields. If you encounter Datapoints that require
    other metadata then is defined in NumericDatapointAddition or
    TextDatapointAddition simply generate a new DatapointAddition model and
    extend use_as_choices and `use_as_addition_models` accordingly.

    TODO: May be replace delete with deactivate, else we will might end with
          entries in the ValueDB with unknown origin (deleted datapoints will
          be rentered but with new id)
