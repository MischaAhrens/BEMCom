# Demo Device

A service that should behave like a simple Modbus device. This tool is solely intended for demonstration of BEMCom. It has no practical value besides this function.

The demo can be interpreted as as a single room for which the temperature is measured and an actor (say an AC system that can heat and cool) exists to manipulate the room temperature.

The demo device exposes the following registers:

| Type             | Register | Data Type   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input Register   | 1        | 16bit float | The current room temperature in 째C.                          |
| Holding Register | 1        | 16bit float | The setpoint for the room temperature in 째C. Values below 15째C and above 30째 are clipped to that range. |
