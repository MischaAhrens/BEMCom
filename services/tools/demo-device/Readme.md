# Demo Device

A service that should behave like a simple Modbus device. This tool is solely intended for demonstration of BEMCom. It has no practical value besides this function.

The demo can be interpreted as as a single roof for which the temperature is measured and an actor (say an AC system that can heat and cool) exist to manipulate the room temperature.  

The demo device exposes the following registers:

| Type             | Number | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input Register   | 1      | The current room temperature in 째C encoded as 16bit float.   |
| Holding Register | 1      | The setpoint for the room temperature also in 째C encoded in the same way as the current room temperature. Values below 15째C and above 30째 are clipped to those values. |



### Configuration

| DEBUG               | TRUE           | If == "TRUE" (i.e. the string) will set the loglevel of the connector the logging.DEBUG. Else is logging.INFO. |

##### Volumes
